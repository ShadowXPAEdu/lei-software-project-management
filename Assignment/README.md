## Problem Statement

A group of students were facing an international pandemic and due to the social distancing, they had the need of new group chat focused on message and file sharing that would allow easier communication and collaboration between people.

## Vision and Scope

This project is expected to allow for an easier communication between a group of students that are working together, and the main goal is to be able to send files associated with all members of the group.

With the need of intensive virtual communication, the use of chats to discuss about different topics, files and their states between the various members, we had the idea of making an application that suits us better, that allows us to share files with open comments in the best and simplest way possible.

### List of features

The users can register themselves, and need to be logged in to perform all the tasks below:

- Messages – allow for real time text messaging between the users inside channels.
- Create Channel - provide topic separation controlled by the users.
- Channel Owner – user that created the channel can fully manage it.
- File Sharing – provide a space to allow for file sharing.
- Files Download – files will be available for everyone that belong to the Channel.
