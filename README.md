# Software Project Management

This subject focused on the creation of an application, including everything up to the actual coding of the application, such as defining the idea, the requirements, planning, risk management, etc. 

## Assignment

This subject had one assignment.

The assignment was to create an idea for an application, and then execute that idea.  
Our idea was to create a very simplified application similar to Discord, with functionalities such as chatting and sending files. The assignment was done in teams of five.  
This repository only includes the code for the application, and not the countless documents created during the semester.
